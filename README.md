### How to use the script

1) Clone/Download script
2) Open your terminal
3) Go to cloned/downloaded script path
4) Create virtual environment <br>

7) Enter your python shell<br>
    *python*
8) import solving function<br>
    *from obscure import solve*
9) import some sudoku sample (there are four of them)<br>
    *from samples import sample1*
10) see how sudoku looks unsolved<br>
